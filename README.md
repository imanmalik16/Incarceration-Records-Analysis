# Project 2 - Incarceration Records

This report analyzes data about incarcerations records for inmates from Travis County as of July 2024. 

I downloaded the CSV file for this data from the [Texas Open Data Portal](https://data.texas.gov/)-- it was already in a downloadable format, no scraping necessary. The data file I attached in the repository is **a compressed version** to fit the GitHub file upload size limit. When downloading, open the zip file and extract the csv file. Rename it to "Currently_Incarcerated_July2024.csv". The name must match the file name in the report for it to be reproduced. 

More information on this dataset can be found [here](https://data.texas.gov/dataset/High-Value-Dataset-July-2024/qz8r-du54/about_data).
