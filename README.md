# Incarceration Records Analysis

This repository contains an R Markdown report, the output as an html file, and a Shiny app to interact with the variables.

The report analyzes data about incarcerations records for inmates from Travis County as of July 2024. 

The CSV file used was downloaded from the [Texas Open Data Portal](https://data.texas.gov/), no scraping necessary. The data file attached is **a compressed version** to fit the GitHub file upload size limit. When downloading, open the zip file and extract the csv file. Rename it to "Currently_Incarcerated_July2024.csv". The name must match the file name in the report for it to be reproduced.
