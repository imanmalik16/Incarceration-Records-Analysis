# Project 2 - Incarceration Records

This report analyzes data about incarcerations records for inmates from Travis County as of July 2024. 

The data file in the repository is **compressed** to fit the GitHub file upload size limit. When downloading, open the zip file and extract the csv file. Rename it to "Currently_Incarcerated_July2024.csv". The name must match the file name in the report for it to be reproduced.
